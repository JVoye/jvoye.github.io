                <p class="margin-med">BNP, for the client review develop a group of concepts in 2D, representing broad topics such as various terminal shapes, single vs multi-level facility, exterior airside interfaces vs interior airside interface aisles, and different operational concepts, etc. The preferred design will include 3D space planning of the Cargo functions to determine the anticipated height of the facility and includes 3D equipment to allow validation of the quantities required versus the provisions in the design. Based on the preferred design BNP will provide rough order magnitude costs and implementation schedules.
                </p>
                <h3 class="feature-box-text__header margin-sm l-blue-dark">Simulation</h3>
                <p class="margin-med">The preferred concept will be developed by BNP into a 3D dynamic discrete event simulation model where the flow of each ULD and each ASRS load unit is modeled. The simulation will be based upon the peak time processing and include the processing of cargo incorporating security and customs requirements. Manual processes (e.g. ULD buildup, forklift movement, Dolly train movement) will be modeled with representative process times coordinated with the client.

                <p>BNP has been developing simulations for the baggage handling and air cargo industries since 1995. BNP’s simulation experience encompasses modeling of simple queuing systems to the largest airport baggage handling systems with over 20,000 individual conveyor sections/tracks. We have a core group of professionals dedicated to providing simulation services to the airport/airline industry. BNP uses simulation modeling tools such as AutoMod and Quest to build 3D models of each system. The simulation model control logic is written to closely represent actual PLC controls of conveyors and cargo systems.
                </p><br>
                <p class="margin-lg">These models are calibrated and validated to ensure that they accurately represent real-world operations.
                    In addition to being world leaders in AutoMod and Quest simulations, we have broad skills in integrating AutoMod/Quest with other applications. We have expertise in SQL databases and Visual Basic combined with MS Excel. These skills are used to import data into the simulation model either at the start of a simulation run or interactively as it runs. BNP simulations can be integrated in real control or management systems to act as an emulation test bed.
                    BNP’s simulation engineers are also skilled in VB, VBA, C# & C++ programming languages.

                                <p class="feature-box-text__subheader">The SimFDS includes key data such as flight schedules, baggage and passenger characteristics, and operational characteristics as well as the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will be used to evaluate the performance of each system. Once these planning assumptions are established, a demand forecast is produced, and initial system resource requirements are estimated.</p>

                    <p class="">These tools have been used to evaluate and assist in the design of over 50 baggage handling systems to include very large BHS and Cargo systems throughout the world and numerous systems in the USA (including TSA mandated checked baggage screening systems).
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="margin-med">Through use of the these models, the projected demand to each component of the BHS (mainline, ICS loops, EBS storage areas, screening areas, make-ups, cargo systems etc.) can be quantified early in the process.  Bottleneck areas with the system can be identified, and design and/or controls improvements can be evaluated. These models help to ensure that new commissioned systems will operate efficiently, and provide a means for identifying effective solutions to existing systems without having to experiment with making changes to a live system.

                                <p class="feature-box-text__subheader">Downstream conveyors are started three seconds prior to the bag physically reaching the charge-end of conveyor. After the last bag exits a conveyor, the conveyor turns off after a pre-set configurable delay varying from 1 to 600 seconds.  Using modeling, the best strategies for powering the system can be refined and system energy consumption can be significantly reduced.</p>
