                        developed for the projected fleet mix, including GSE parking and vehicle service lanes.
                        As necessary, several alternatives are also considered to optimize the various
                        evaluation criteria including aircraft fleet mix, gate/aircraft interchangeability,

                    <p>The passenger loading bridge generalities are also
                        developed including approximate PBB tunnel lengths, range of aircraft servicing needs,
                        maximum slopes and facility interface coordination. Point-of-use versus centralized 400
                        Hz and PC air studies are developed as well as Potable Water requirements. VDGS system
                        layout and the interface to the Passenger Boarding Bridges are also developed when they
                        are a requirement of the project.

                            will include requirements for special storage areas, storage for oversize cargo, empty ULD
                            Storage, sorter systems for parcels and small packages. With this information, a proposed
                            Concept of Operations will be developed. This is the most significant part of analysis and

                <p>BNP has been developing simulations for the baggage handling and air cargo industries since 1995.
                    BNP’s simulation experience encompasses modeling of simple queuing systems to the largest
                    airport baggage handling systems with over 20,000 individual conveyor sections/tracks. We have a
                    core group of professionals dedicated to providing simulation services to the airport/airline
                    industry. BNP uses simulation modeling tools such as AutoMod and Quest to build 3D models of
                    each system. The simulation model control logic is written to closely represent actual PLC
                    controls of conveyors and cargo systems.
                </p><br>
                <p class="mb-xl">These models are calibrated and validated to ensure that they accurately
                    represent real-world operations.
                    In addition to being world leaders in AutoMod and Quest simulations, we have broad skills in
                    integrating AutoMod/Quest with other applications. We have expertise in SQL databases and Visual
                    Basic combined with MS Excel. These skills are used to import data into the simulation model
                    either at the start of a simulation run or interactively as it runs. BNP simulations can be
                    integrated in real control or management systems to act as an emulation test bed.
                    BNP’s simulation engineers are also skilled in VB, VBA, C# & C++ programming languages.

                    <p>As part of the BNP simulation/modeling process,
                        detailed demand forecasts are developed to quantify the expected demand to the baggage and
                        cargo systems. BNP documents all the key data and assumptions for the project and produce a
                        Simulation Function Design Specifications (SimFDS) deliverable.</p><br>
                    <p>The SimFDS includes key data such as flight schedules,
                        baggage and passenger characteristics, and operational characteristics as well as the Key
                        Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will be used to evaluate the performance of each system.
                        Once these planning assumptions are established, a demand forecast is produced, and initial
                        system resource requirements are estimated.</p>

                <p>These tools have been used to evaluate and assist in the design of over 50 baggage handling
                    systems to include very large BHS and Cargo systems throughout the world and numerous systems in the
                    USA (including TSA mandated checked baggage screening systems).
                </p><br>
                <p class="mb-lg">Through use of the these models, the projected demand to each component of the BHS
                    (mainline, ICS loops, EBS storage areas, screening areas, make-ups, cargo systems etc.) can be
                    quantified early in the process. Bottleneck areas with the system can be identified, and design
                    and/or controls improvements can be evaluated. These models help to ensure that new commissioned
                    systems will operate efficiently, and provide a means for identifying effective solutions to
                    existing systems without having to experiment with making changes to a live system.

                <p>One of the specialized uses of BNP’s simulation models is
                    to identify the potential energy savings that can be achieved by managing the run time of
                    conveyors/components. Using VFDs, conveyors will only run while bags are approaching the
                    conveyor.</p><br>
                <p>Downstream conveyors are started three seconds prior to
                    the bag physically reaching the charge-end of conveyor. After the last bag exits a conveyor,
                    the conveyor turns off after a pre-set configurable delay varying from 1 to 600 seconds.
                    Using modeling, the best strategies for powering the system can be refined and system energy
                    consumption can be significantly reduced.</p>
