                <p>
                    As the COVID-19 crisis continues to impact our lives, airports are considering new bag sanitizing
                    technologies to help reduce the spread of harmful contagions. One promising disinfection solution is
                    exposing surfaces at risk of human contact to concentrated doses of ultraviolet C (UVC) light. In
                    baggage handling systems, this would take the form of an in-line baggage tunnel that doses baggage
                    with UVC radiation as it transitions through the baggage system either from check-in counter to
                    make-up area or from arrival belt to claim carousel. Since the sanitation status of checked baggage
                    is unknown when presented by the passenger, any contagion that might reside on the bag could
                    transfer to personnel handling it; such as check-in agents, TSA employees, baggage system
                    maintenance personnel and baggage handlers. These individuals may then contaminate other bags and
                    surfaces in the airport, propagating the contagion. Similarly, bags arriving from other airports
                    could also have surface contaminants. The implementation of UVC exposure tunnels in the baggage
                    system could mitigate this risk, helping to keep both airport personnel and passengers safer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the electromagnetic spectrum, ultraviolet light is adjacent to the violet end of the visible
                    light span. Standard UVC light occupies the band of light between 200 and 280 nm, the shortest
                    wavelength of ultraviolet light that can propagate through the atmosphere. It has been found that
                    the range between 253.7 and 265 nm is extremely effective at killing harmful germs and inactivating
                    dangerous virus strains. The energetic nature of UVC light causes it to damage living tissue and
                    degrade certain plastics. UVC light is emitted from the sun along with ultraviolet A and B. However,
                    UVC is entirely absorbed in the stratosphere and never makes it to the surface of the earth.
                </p>
                <div class="news__img">
                    <img src="/images/news/sanitizing-airport-baggage/electromagnetic-spectrum.jpg" alt="Electromagnetic Spectrum" class="mb-sm">
                    <p class="news__caption">Figure 1: The ultraviolet light band on the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    All light follows the Inverse Square Law as it radiates outward from a point source, which states
                    that the perceived intensity at any point is inversely proportional to the square of its distance
                    from the source of light. To simplify, doubling the distance from a light source will cause a
                    quarter of the intensity to be received. What this means is that the closer we can get a bag to the
                    UV source, the lower the doses that needs to be emitted to provided effective cleaning of baggage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aggressive nature of UVC light may cause some to wonder whether a concentrated dose could cause
                    significant harm not only to dangerous contaminates but also to the bag itself. Recent studies on
                    the effect of UVC doses on the structural integrity of N95 respirator masks imply that the answer is
                    “No”. The Emergency Care Research Institute has consolidated many of these studies and they indicate
                    that the dose necessary to provide a 99.9% surface disinfection is much lower than doses that could
                    cause meaningful damage to these masks. As for the contents of each bag, passengers need not worry
                    since UVC light has very low permeation capabilities and there is virtually no chance of damage to
                    any UV-sensitive items in the bag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The safety risks of UVC should be recognized and protected against. UVC light can cause damage to
                    both the eyes and skin, leading to a host of health issues from burns to cornea injury. Along with
                    the proper application of shielding and draft curtains recommended by BNP, emergency stop procedures
                    have been developed to prevent accidental UVC exposure to living tissue. Additionally, in more
                    potentially high-risk areas, upstream sensors can be installed to automatically halt system
                    operation when living things are detected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several BHS suppliers have started designing and conceptualizing UVC tunnel equipment, the most
                    notable examples being Glidepath Group’s UVC Bag Sanitizer and Robson Handling Technology’s UV-C
                    Baggage Treatment System. Glidepath has issued a specification sheet for their UVC Bag Sanitizer
                    describing details such as power requirements and system interfacing. Robson’s system has a modular
                    design allowing for customization based on specific system requirements and disinfection rates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BNP has been pursuing several concepts where sanitizing equipment such as UVC tunnel equipment can
                    be placed within existing and new baggage handling systems. One such concept is shown below where UV
                    tunnels are placed just upstream of the EDS machines. In this application, we use the space between
                    the diverter and the screening machine for both queuing and sanitizing the bag.
                </p>

                    <p class="news__caption">Figure 2: Example UVC Sanitizer Placement</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Smiths Detection has also developed a UVC add-on kit that sanitizes passenger checkpoint trays
                    between uses. The kit is designed to retrofit any existing tray handling system at passenger
                    screening to provide automated disinfection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This technology could be a welcome addition to any airport to provide an extra measure of safety and
                    peace of mind for both passengers and airline and airport employees. UVC tunnel technology is being
                    developed by several different entities at this time, and prototypes have been implemented at Cochin
                    International Airport Ltd and Indira Gandhi International Airport. These prototypes were engineered
                    by the Naval Physical & Oceanographic Laboratory of India and the Delhi International Airport Ltd
                    respectively.

                    BNP is a leader in bringing new technologies to airport baggage handling systems. We are committed
                    to developing solutions that improve the safety, security, and efficiency of baggage operations.
