    <p class="abel_reg">BNP Associates, Inc. is a company Iâ€™ve worked for as a Multimedia Designer for the last 5+ years. Recently in 2019 I took on the role of a Jr. Front-end Web Developer in addition to my other responsibilities and developed this site for the company. The goal was to create a responsive website that had an interactive map of the companies current and past projects in addition to a weekly newletter.  </p>
