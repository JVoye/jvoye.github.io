The project was a mixture of brownfield and greenfield works in a live active system in one of the busiest airports in Northern Europe.  Multiple conceptual options were explored with the airport in a series of workshops with the concept that was built being preferred because of the lower implementation risk, the elimination of a legacy make-up and sortation area with substandard conditions and the provision of a new modern baggage make-up area (BF West).":
		"2017年3月，在位于美国康涅狄格州的BNP总部举行的启动研讨会标志着项目规划的开始。该项目需要在北欧最繁忙的机场之一的一个运行系统中进行新建和改扩建的混合工作。在与机场进行的一系列研讨会中，对多个概念方案进行了探讨，最终选取的方案实施风险较低，移除了老旧的装运和分拣区域，并提供了一个新的现代化行李装运区(西行李机房)。", 

		"After an in-depth design process coordinating building facilities and detailed construction phases with various stakeholders, the project was tendered in early 2018 with the contracts awarded to Vanderlande Industries for the BHS and Rapiscan for the HBS machines in July that same year. The contractor’s detailed design process started immediately with the first of more than 8 major construction phases with multiple sub-phases starting in December 2018.":
		"经过细节设计阶段，与各个相关部门协调建筑设施和详细的分阶段施工之后，该项目于2018年初招标，同年7月授予Vanderlande Industries 行李系统合同，授予Rapiscan 安检设备合同。承包商的深化设计过程随即启动，整个项目有超过八个主施工阶段，每个主阶段包括多个子阶段。第一主阶段于2018年12月开始。", 

		"Phase 1 & 2 – involved upgrading the existing baggage factory with ECAC Standard 3 machines while maintaining live operations. The reconciliation room was also reconfigured for Level 3 operation under the new HBS system for a more efficient and optimized operation. This was accomplished with multiple sub-phases and thorough coordination with BHS operations, CPH security, and other stakeholders. This was completed in December 2019.":
		"第一和第二阶段 – 包括了应用ECAC标准3安检设备升级现有行李机房，同时维持日常运行。调解室也被重新按照三级安检运行下的新HBS系统进行配置，以进行高效和优化的操作。此项工作是通过多个子阶段完成的，并与BHS运营、哥本哈根机场安全部门和其他相关部门进行了深入细致的协调。该阶段于2019年12月完成。", 

		"Phase 3 – upgrade of existing Transfer screening operation to ECAC Standard 3. This was also completed in December 2019.":
		"第三阶段 – 将现有的中转安检运行升级为ECAC标准3。该阶段也于2019年12月完成。", 

		"Phase 4 – involved dismantling an entire baggage factory in Terminal 2 used for screening and sortation and replacing it with an expanded security operation utilizing ECAC Standard 3 machines. This phase was broken down into 8 sub-phases due to tie-ins to existing Check-in Operations and connection to existing baggage factory. Due to Covid, airport operations slowed significantly which allowed the project to consolidate 5 sub-phases down to 2.":
		"第四阶段 – 拆除2号航站楼用于安检和分拣的整个行李机房，并使用ECAC标准3设备扩展安检的运行。由于需要与现有的值机相连接，和与现有行李机房相连接，这一阶段被分为8个子阶段。由于新冠肺炎疫情的影响，机场运营明显放缓，使该项目中的5个子阶段得以合并为2个子阶段。", 

		"Phase 5 & 6 – removal of the remaining Standard 2 EDS machines.":
		"第五和第六阶段 – 移除余下的标准2 EDS机器。", 

		"Phase 7 – This phase created a new baggage factory (Bagagefabrik vest / Baggage Factory West) that significantly expands CPH’s capacity for make-up, early bag storage and has a new Tilt-Tray Sorter at the heart of the system.":
		"第七阶段 – 该阶段新建了一个行李机房(Bagagefabrik背心/ 西行李机房)，显著提升了哥本哈根机场的装运和早到存储能力，并在系统的核心设置了一套全新的翻盘分拣机。", 

		"Phase 8 – The final phase upgraded the existing High Level Control System of CPH that was very complex and connected to internal and external interfaces. The new High Level Control System connected the existing system and Phase 1-7 to allow the Baggage Control Operation to manage the entire Baggage System in one platform.":
		"第八阶段 – 最终阶段升级了哥本哈根机场现有的高端控制系统，该系统非常复杂并与内部和外部有多个接口。新的高端控制系统将现有系统和第一至第七阶段连接起来，使行李控制运作在一个统一的平台上管理整个行李系统。", 

		"The systems involved were certified by Denmark’s CAA - Trafikstyrelsen as certified for operation. Copenhagen Airport (CPH) was able to upgrade all HBS equipment before the EU Regulation 1081/2011 deadline of September 2020.":
		"所涉及的系统通过了丹麦CAA - traafikstyrelsen的运行认证。哥本哈根机场(CPH)在2020年9月欧盟法规1081/2011的最后期限之前成功的升级了所有HBS设备。", 

		"BNP provided concept design, simulation, detailed design, tender documents, and pre-construction services. Once the project was awarded, BNP continued supporting CPH with full-time on-site supervision. BNP’s commitment to CPH from the start of this journey continued through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. BNP maintained a continuous site presence throughout the project to manage a complex project compounded by the unprecedented challenges of the lockdowns and travel restriction. The project managed to stay on schedule and Baggage Factory West went operational in May 2021.":
		"BNP提供了概念设计、模拟、细节设计、招标文件和施工前服务。项目中标后，BNP继续为哥本哈根机场提供了全职现场监理服务。BNP从始至终兑现了对哥本哈根机场的服务承诺，并在新冠肺炎大流行的挑战中持续前行。BNP在整个项目中提供了全程在场服务以管理一个复杂的项目，同时要面临前所未有的封锁和旅行限制的挑战。该项目成功的按计划实施，西行李机房于2021年5月开始运行。", 

		"BNP has been a proud partner of Copenhagen Airport since 2011 and has been honored to work hand in hand with CPH to assist them in their goal of being the premier airport for Scandinavia and Europe.":
		"2011年以来，BNP一直为哥本哈根机场的合作伙伴，很荣幸与CPH携手合作，协助其实现成为和欧洲领军机场的目标。"
