                    Global aviation has undergone many changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Air travel, once at a standstill during the peak of the pandemic, is slowly resuming. Given the highly transmissible nature of COVID-19, social distancing rules and policies are likely to be the norm for the near future at all airports until a vaccine is developed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Social distancing will alter how passengers are processed at check-in lobbies, passenger security screening checkpoints, customs and border protection immigration screening, and baggage claim halls. New social distancing rules will result in terminal layout changes, alter airline staff and passenger interactions, and increase the amount of space needed to accommodate passengers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Utilizing 3D simulation tools, BNP has been working with airports and airlines to review existing terminal capacities to identify alternatives for implementing social distancing queuing strategies. Prior to COVID-19, a typical strategy was to maximize the number of counter positions and provide passengers with just enough space to comfortably wait in queue. Kiosks and agent counters were placed adjacent to each other to maximize efficiency. For a check-in area of 300 sq. ft., 30 passengers could be accommodated comfortably, providing about 10 sq. ft. per passenger. A typical pre-COVID-19 check-in lobby with a single passenger queue is shown below.
                </p>
           
            <div class="margin-sm-med">
                <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 55%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/425158529" width="640" height="331" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
            </div>
            <p>
                However, such close spacing of passengers is no longer permitted due to social distancing requirements. BNP has evaluated several viable solutions to safely accommodate and process passengers at airport passenger processing facilities. One of the challenges is to quantify how much space needs to be dedicated to the check-in process. Two competing factors are at play; one being the reduction in flight load factors as air carriers are filling fewer seats, the other maintaining 6 ft. of separation between passengers in check-in halls when the number of usable check-in positions has also been reduced. Using simulation, rapidly changing queue requirements are evaluated and alternative strategies for queuing passengers in the check-in lobby are considered. As load factors return to higher levels, alternative queue strategies can be evaluated to best accommodate passengers in the available space.
            </p>
            <p>
                One social distancing concept is to space passengers and check-in agent positions to maintain a 6 ft separation in all directions. Stanchions are placed such that adjacent rows of the passenger queue are at least 6 ft. apart, allowing the passenger queue to operate in a snake configuration. Visible markers are placed on the floor to help guide passengers to permissible standing locations and non-permissible distancing locations. The permissible locations are 6 ft. apart and passengers can advance forward to the next permissible spot once it is empty. Every other check-in position is open to provide separation between passengers at adjacent counters. This configuration maintains front-to-back and side-to-side separations of 6 feet at a density of 8 passengers in a 300 sq. ft. area, averaging 36 sq. ft. per passenger.
            </p>
            <div class="margin-sm-med">
                <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 55%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/425158796" width="640" height="331" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Similarly, the queue areas could be broken into multiple queueing zones. In the next example, 6 ft. spacing is also provided between the queues. Such a layout results in 6 passengers per 300 sq. ft., or approximately 50 sq. ft. per passenger. Although it might be easier to manage passengers in multiple queues, especially where multiple airlines are being served, as the number of separate queues increases, the overall utilization of the check-in space is reduced.
            </p>
            <div class="margin-sm-med">
                <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 55%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/425159026" width="640" height="331" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
            </div>
            <p>
                When high density queueing is required, plexiglass dividers could be added to the existing queues. This might be a solution when load factors return to pre-COVID-19 levels. The plexiglass dividers would allow passengers to pass each other in adjacent queue rows with the rows being less than 6 feet apart. The plexiglass option can provide a queueing space of 15 passengers for every 300 sq. ft. with an average space requirement of 20 sq. ft. per passenger. The plexiglass concept with alternating use of agent counters and a single queue is shown below.
            </p>
            <div class="margin-sm-med">
                <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 55%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/425159144" width="640" height="331" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Although this option increases the density of passengers in the check-in area, the plexiglass will need to be cleaned and disinfected regularly and is more difficult to move as queuing requirements evolve.
            </p>
            <p>
                As load factors increase, the number of agent positions in use could potentially be increased by adding separators between adjacent counter positions. Demand forecasting and simulation help to identify when those threshold levels will be reached.
            </p>

                BNP has developed these tools to help airports and airlines respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using these simulation tools, we can evaluate the impact of alternative social-distancing intervention concepts to develop efficient and cost-effective solutions for airports. This information will help airports better manage social distancing requirements and provide safer and effective airport operations.
