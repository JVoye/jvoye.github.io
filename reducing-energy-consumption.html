                    <p>
                        The reduction in passenger traffic due to COVID-19 comes with a corresponding reduction in checked baggage volumes, making the importance of having energy efficient airport baggage systems even more critical. In many of today’s baggage systems, energy is wasted when conveyors run while no bags are present. This is due to the baggage handling systems being designed with a Zone Methodology approach, wherein a group of conveyors are started at the same time and run continuously until the zone has been cleared of bags for 10 or more minutes. This results in running many conveyors unnecessarily during low demand periods. When bag volume is low, there is a poor return in energy consumed to the number of bags handled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Enhanced Drives can start and stop conveyors with essentially no detrimental effect on the drive system, eliminating the need for large conveyor zones. Enhanced Drives can make the overall system or process more energy efficient by only using the motors when required or tuning the motor output for a desired operation. Running conveyors only when bags are present is referred to as a “Small Group Methodology.” Enhanced Drives include Soft Starter for Motors (SSMs), Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs), Permanent Magnet Motors (PMMs), and Synchronous Reluctance Motors (SRMs).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        BNP has evaluated the Small Group Methodology as an option for the replacement and upgrade of existing systems. The theory is simple, only run a conveyor when a bag is present, and do not run the conveyor when there are no bags. The logic implemented for Small Group Methodology will turn the motor at a fixed location prior to the bag reaching the conveyor, and will turn the motor off after a fixed time after the bag exits the conveyor, if no other bags are present.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Simulation modeling was used to estimate total daily power consumption for multiple conveyor time-out delay settings. This study was performed at a major hub airport in the United States and included the flow of originating bags from induction at ticket counters through delivery of all bags to the final makeup devices. Operations including ticketing, baggage screening, explosive trace detection and manual encode were modeled, incorporating all conveyors, merges, and diverters from induction to makeup device for the outbound Baggage Handling System.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3 class=" blog-story__headings margin-sm">Zone Methodology</h3>

                    <p>
                        In the Zone Methodology, all the conveyors in the zone are restarted at the same time, with only brief cascade restart delays between conveyors. In the Zone Methodology analysis, all the conveyors in a zone were set to run continuously until no bags were seen in that zone for 10 minutes. This resulted in running many conveyors for an extended time, even during low demand periods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Figure 1 shows an example of a conveyor line running using the Zone Methodology. If a bag enters the ticket counter in Zone 1, all twenty conveyors in Zone 1 are restarted. When the bag reaches the Zone 2 auto-start trigger photo-eye, all forty conveyors in Zone 2 are started. Each zone will continue to run for approximately 10 minutes after the zone is clear of all bags before auto-stopping. If another bag enters the zone in that period, the timeout timing is reset, and the conveyor must run for 10 minutes without any bags before the zone stops.
                    </p>

                <h3 class=" blog-story__headings margin-sm">Small Group Methodology with Enhanced Drives</h3>
                    <p>
                        The use of Enhanced Drives throughout the BHS along with the Small Group Methodology eliminates the need for conveyor zones. Enhanced Drives allow individual motor control, ramped start and stop of conveyors, and adjustment of the motors to the current process load, creating more versatile conveyors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Downstream conveyors are started a few seconds prior to the bag reaching the conveyor. The trigger point is located at an upstream photo-eye with a fixed offset travel time to the charge-end of the conveyor. After the bag exits a conveyor, the conveyor turns off after a time-out delay, if no other bags have reached the upstream photo-eye. If a fault occurs or the downstream conveyor is stopped, the conveyors will become idle and the upstream conveyors will cascade stop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The logic implemented in the simulation consists of a variable time-out delay that will turn off the motor after the last bag exits the conveyor. Various time-outs values from one second to 10 minutes were evaluated to understand both the impact to energy consumption and the frequency of conveyor stoppages and restarts.
                    </p>

                        In some cases, a bag could be downstream from a conveyor, and trip the startup PE; however, the bag may divert to another line before reaching the conveyor. If a bag fails to reach the end of the conveyor within a specified amount of time, then the time out delay timer starts. If no additional bags arrive to the conveyor or no additional bags cross the startup PE during the time-out delay, then the conveyor is stopped upon expiration of the timer.
                    </p>

                <h3 class=" blog-story__headings margin-sm">Energy Calculation Methodology</h3>
                    <p>
                        The daily run time for each conveyor is determined by monitoring each conveyor’s status throughput the simulation. Under the implementation of the Small Group Methodology, each motor will start at a constant time Startup Time N before a bag reaches the charge end of the conveyor and will stop running following the timeout delay after the bag has completely exit the conveyor. The conveyor will continue to operate if another crosses the startup PE bag before the timeout delay expires.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The formula for computing the daily runtime where each conveyor is its own Small Zone with (for “N” conveyors in the system) in operation over a day is as follows:
                    </p>

                        Startup Time i,t= the time for the head end of the bag to travel from the startup controlling PE for Small Zone i to the head end of the first conveyor in Small Zone i, in minute t

                        Time to Stop i,t= time conveyor i continues to run in time t after the bag the bag exited conveyor before the time out delay timer expires. If another bag trips the startup PE before the timeout expires, then the belt will not stop.

                        The simulation generates the run time in minutes for each conveyor, as well as the number of times each conveyor is started each minute. The required horsepower for each conveyor is calculated using BNP’s modified CEMA (Conveyor Equipment Manufacturers Association) standards. Using the conveyors nominal horsepower, the daily runtime energy in KWh is calculated. This formula includes a penalty for the energy used by a conveyor during startup (typically for NEMA B motors) and the startup time required:

                    <p>
                        The total energy consumed by the system is the sum of the energy consumed by each of the conveyors in the system.

                        Both the Small Group Methodology and Zone Methodology for the proposed BHS was modeled over a twenty-four-hour period. The total energy consumption and corresponding average startups per conveyor for each timeout delay over the entire day are provided in Figure 3

                <p>
                    The simulation modeling demonstrated that substantial energy savings can be achieved by implementing a Small Zone Methodology and turning motors off when bags are not present.
                    As the timeout delay is decreased, the daily energy consumption reduces since conveyors run for a shorter amount of time. At a one-second timeout delay, the Small Zone Methodology provides an estimated 59% power savings compared to the Zone Methodology with a ten-minute zone time out.
