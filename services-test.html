This will include requirements for special storage areas, storage for oversize cargo, empty ULD Storage, sorter systems for parcels and small packages. With this information, a proposed Concept of Operations will be developed. This is the most significant part of analysis and the concept design study and involves the highest levels of expertise, creativity and engineering acumen.</p>

            <p class="margin-med">BNP, for the client review develop a group of concepts in 2D, representing broad topics such as various terminal shapes, single vs multi-level facility, exterior airside interfaces vs interior airside interface aisles, and different operational concepts, etc. The preferred design will include 3D space planning of the Cargo functions to determine the anticipated height of the facility and includes 3D equipment to allow validation of the quantities required versus the provisions in the design. Based on the preferred design BNP will provide rough order magnitude costs and implementation schedules.
            </p>
            <h3 class="feature-box-text__header margin-sm l-blue-dark">Simulation</h3>
            <p class="margin-med">The preferred concept will be developed by BNP into a 3D dynamic discrete event simulation model where the flow of each ULD and each ASRS load unit is modeled. The simulation will be based upon the peak time processing and include the processing of cargo incorporating security and customs requirements. Manual processes (e.g. ULD buildup, forklift movement, Dolly train movement) will be modeled with representative process times coordinated with the client.
