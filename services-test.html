                        <p class="feature-box-text__subheader">Baseline aircraft parking plan alternatives are developed for the projected fleet mix, including GSE parking and vehicle service lanes. As necessary, several alternatives are also considered to optimize the various evaluation criteria including aircraft fleet mix, gate/aircraft interchangeability, passenger loading distributions, etc.</p><br>
                        
                        <p class="feature-box-text__subheader">The passenger loading bridge generalities are also developed including approximate PBB tunnel lengths, range of aircraft servicing needs, maximum slopes and facility interface coordination. Point-of-use versus centralized 400 Hz and PC air studies are developed as well as Potable Water requirements. VDGS system layout and the interface to the Passenger Boarding Bridges are also developed when they are a requirement of the project.<p>
