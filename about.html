                <h3 class="denver-office__header" lang="en">Design</h3>
                <p lang="en">BNP's CAD system consists of latest technology workstations running the most current version of AutoCAD and Revit. This software is enhanced by BNPCAD which consists of a symbol library specific to the airline industry and more specifically to Baggage, Cargo and Apron systems. Our designers use the latest version of Autodesk Building Design Suite to design and model baggage and cargo systems.</p><br>

                <h3 class="denver-office__header" lang="en">Engineering</h3>
                <p lang="en">Our engineering systems provide standardized spreadsheet, word processing and database programs for modeling baggage system requirements, tracking bids, shop drawing logs and a host of construction service tools. All scheduling is accomplished using Microsoft Project. The specifications are standardized in CSI format and are assembled from word processing templates.
                </p><br>

                <h3 class="denver-office__header" lang="en">IT Systems</h3>
