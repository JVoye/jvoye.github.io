                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>A critical component in the successful and economic execution of a project is the application of advanced technology. In this regard, BNP has strived to equip its operations with automation to improve our product and reduce the cost to our clients by improving productivity and improving accuracy through standardization. The key components of our systems include:</p>

                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>BNP's CAD system consists of latest technology workstations running the most current version of AutoCAD and Revit. This software is enhanced by BNPCAD which consists of a symbol library specific to the airline industry and more specifically to Baggage, Cargo and Apron systems. Our designers use the latest version of Autodesk Building Design Suite to design and model baggage and cargo systems.</p>

                <h3>Engineering</h3>
                <p>Our engineering systems provide standardized spreadsheet, word processing and database programs for modeling baggage system requirements, tracking bids, shop drawing logs and a host of construction service tools. All scheduling is accomplished using Microsoft Project. The specifications are standardized in CSI format and are assembled from word processing templates.</p>

                <h3>IT Systems</h3>
                <p>All BNP offices are fully networked with a common virtual server and daily back-up/disaster recovery capability. BNP's IT systems are state of the art, easily expandable and can be setup within remote offices without the need for server installations. Our centralized storage systems are cloud based and fully redundant. We utilize Procure as a collaborative Project and Construction Management tool. E-mail is accomplished using high availability commercial services.</p>

                <p class="margin-lg">BHSS and CHSS are simulation applications developed specifically for baggage and cargo handling systems. It has been developed using the experience of many baggage and cargo projects. The result is a proven product that models belt, ICS and tilt tray based baggage systems, as well as ULD and bin systems accurately and quickly. BNP utilizes three simulation software packages.</p>
