                <h3 class="denver-office__header">Technology</h3>
                <p>A critical component in the successful and economic execution of a project is the application of
                    advanced technology. In this regard, BNP has strived to equip its operations with automation to
                    improve our product and reduce the cost to our clients by improving productivity and improving
                    accuracy through standardization. The key components of our systems include:</p><br>

                <h3 class="denver-office__header">Design</h3>
                <p>BNP's CAD system consists of latest technology workstations running the most current version of
                    AutoCAD and Revit. This software is enhanced by BNPCAD which consists of a symbol library
                    specific to the airline industry and more specifically to Baggage, Cargo and Apron systems. Our
                    designers use the latest version of Autodesk Building Design Suite to design and model baggage
                    and cargo systems.</p><br>

                <h3 class="denver-office__header">Engineering</h3>
                <p>Our engineering systems provide standardized spreadsheet, word processing and database programs
                    for modeling baggage system requirements, tracking bids, shop drawing logs and a host of
                    construction service tools. All scheduling is accomplished using Microsoft Project. The
                    specifications are standardized in CSI format and are assembled from word processing templates.
                </p><br>

                <h3 class="denver-office__header">IT Systems</h3>
                <p>All BNP offices are fully networked with a common virtual server and daily back-up/disaster
                    recovery capability. BNP's IT systems are state of the art, easily expandable and can be setup
                    within remote offices without the need for server installations. Our centralized storage systems
                    are cloud based and fully redundant. We utilize Procure as a collaborative Project and
                    Construction Management tool. E-mail is accomplished using high availability commercial
                    services.</p><br>

            <h3 class="denver-office__header">AviPlan</h3>
            <p>Software package that allows us to accurately model the complex swept paths of taxing aircraft as
                well as multi-unit baggage and cargo dolly trains.</p><br>

            <h3 class="denver-office__header">Simulation</h3>
            <p>BHSS and CHSS are simulation applications developed specifically for baggage and cargo handling
                systems. It has been developed using the experience of many baggage and cargo projects. The
                result is a proven product that models belt, ICS and tilt tray based baggage systems, as well as
                ULD and bin systems accurately and quickly. BNP utilizes three simulation software packages.</p>
